SampleProject
=============

This is a sample project. It is the way how I could create a sw with all the
build and test scripts. It includes all the batch files to be called from the
build system, and 3 levels of testing.

The sample sw is doing rot13 encoding/decoding in quite a complicated way for
demonstration purposes. For more info see http://decode.org/ or
https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html?highlight=rot13#text-transforms
